# Graph Database Learning Project (Python)

This project is a simple starting point for learning about graph databases using Python.

## Project Structure

- `src/graphdb.py`: Core logic for interacting with a graph database (to be implemented/expanded).
- `src/main.py`: Entry point for running and testing your graph database code.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
	```bash
	python3 -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate
	```
3. **Install dependencies** (if any):
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	# or use poetry if configured
	```
4. **Explore the code** in the `src/` folder and start experimenting!

## What is a Graph Database?
A graph database is a type of database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. It is especially useful for representing relationships and networks, such as social connections, recommendation systems, and more.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the basics of graph data models (nodes, edges, properties)
- Learn how to represent and query graph data in Python
- Experiment with simple graph algorithms

## Resources
- [Neo4j Graph Database](https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/)
- [Introduction to Graph Databases](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-graph-databases/)
- [NetworkX Python Library](https://networkx.org/)

## Next Steps
- Implement basic graph operations in `graphdb.py`
- Try out simple queries and algorithms
- Explore using libraries like NetworkX or connecting to Neo4j

Happy learning!
